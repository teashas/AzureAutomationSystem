### Interview 6:

**Summary:** Isaac is an old-school gamer who was interested in using the application to make some of his old Pokemon teams from the gameboy era. He wasn’t too interested in the sharing aspect of the application and made it clear that the UI had to have a Pokemon feel to it.


**Interviewer:** Ricardo Chairez\
**Interviewee:** Isaac Barron\
**When:** 7/10/2022\
**Consumer Segment:** Adult gamer

**Key Insights:**
  - The UI needs to have sprites of the Pokemon and have a Pokemon feel to it.
  - There needs to be a way to sort the 800+ Pokemon. Pokemon have many different qualities, so there should be many options to sort from.
   
**Representative quotes:**
  - “I need to see sprites (images) of the Pokemon I’m selecting.”
  - “It would be sick if the UI resembled one of the old gameboy games”
  - “I want to make generation-specific teams because I don’t really mess with the new stuff”

**Hypotheses that were validated:**
   - Familiar UI as well as sort and search functions will benefit user experience.


**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
  - Must have - Images of the Pokemon, search bar to find specific Pokemon.
  - Nice to have - Pokemon “feel” to the UI and sort by release date.
  - Don’t care - Wasn’t interested in the sharing aspect.
